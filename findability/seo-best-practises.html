          <h3>How to create a findable webpage</h3>
          <br />
          When optimizing a website for search engines best practices and
          development techniques are used in order to create a findable web page
          on the internet.
          <br /><br />
          &bull;&nbsp;Of most importance is that HTML code is semantically
          structured and includes content in its appropriate tags. So that
          machines can easily interpret the context of the information. Meaning
          that for example, heading tags are used for headings, so a crawler can
          know this heading information is the heading for its following
          content. Accessibility standards are also involved in this structure
          for similar reasons. If the content is more accessible to the whole
          population, the user's interaction is improved as the structure is
          readable to tools such as screen readers and also your average person
          viewing the website.
          <br /><br />
          &bull;&nbsp;Organic search traffic keywords are used to aid in
          producing hits from search queries. This labeling of website
          components in a descriptive way will facilitate users being able to
          find the page from searches. So it is important to have keywords that
          are appropriate to the website's content and likely to be identified
          with by the users who will be searching for content. At the same time
          unique words and phrases can help to differentiate the website in
          search results from other similar pages. If multiple words or phrases
          are being in urls a dash is the convention used to space between the
          words. For example, “www.exampledomain.com/multiple-words”, however no
          dashes should appear on the domain. This convention is the most
          interoperable again to both crawlers and users alike. Allowing for the
          findability of URLS to be in a way pragmatic. The domain is an easy
          thing to remember and type, while the more complicated descriptions
          are decluttered and spaced out.
          <br /><br />
          &bull;&nbsp;If a website user cannot find something, the use of a 404
          page will help to get users re orientated. This page will occur in a
          browser if the URL entered returns a not found response. This error
          catching response is handy to inform a user when a resource is
          unavailable, and should provide navigation to get back to actual content,
          as well as an explanation on what is happening, so that users are
          encouraged to not give up on browsing the domain.
          <br /><br />
          &bull;&nbsp;Contact information is best formatted in a microformat so
          that it is standardized and understood by tools used in the internet
          world. This extra class attribute markup just helps identify where the
          contact information is, and makes the information portable outside of
          the domain to tools such as extensions. Also the contact information
          should be downloadable by link in .vcf format to platforms such as
          contact information books on the actual devices users are using.
          <br /><br />
          &bull;&nbsp;So that crawlers can store and index your website,
          platforms such as Google Search Console and Bing webmasters provide a
          way for your domain to be findable in their search engine results.
          These platforms require sites to be SEO compatible and provide tools
          to make sure that all of the criteria is present to facilitate the
          indexing of the pages. Important features that a domain should include
          for these platforms are a sitemap.xml and robots.txt files. These
          files list what should be findable to crawlers and can specify
          conditions where no results should appear along with page importance.
          The consoles also provide webmasters with basic traffic data to
          analyze and metric reports on errors.
          <br /><br />
          &bull;&nbsp;HTTP traffic analysis platforms such as Google Analytics
          paired with Google Search Console, along with server side log
          analyzers such as GoAccess. Help to further optimise certain specific
          areas of a website through monitoring metrics. Or for example, if the
          number of visitors from one type of device are too low, you can try to
          improve the results with the coding of the site or even focus on
          marketing in that area. These platforms also provide error metrics
          that report on findability issues. Error metrics such as https status
          codes and not found 404 responses can be identified and then improved
          upon to optimise the site.
