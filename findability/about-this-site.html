          <h3>Improving Findability</h3>
          <br />
          &bull;&nbsp;Semmatic mark and accessibility features are used in this
          site to facilitate the findability of the content to search engine
          crawlers and other technologies, as well as allowing for an
          understandable structure that people can navigate and interpret.
          Keywords describing the content have been chosen to correlate with
          what people possibly might be searching for in an engine, while also
          at the same time being appropriate to the content. For example the
          phrase “community football league” is placed inside an HTML5 emphasis
          tag on the homepage, and is styled according to WCAG contrast
          accessibility standards, in order to enhance readability for both
          machines and people. The combination of this structure and content
          allows people to firstly find the site organically from search
          engines. Arrive and find other relevant content such as the membership
          form which involves specifying an actual league. Taxonomy or
          classification and information hierarchy has been optimised throughout
          the site. Such as in the findability blog, where wordpress was used to
          create posts that are well structured and organised and included tags
          pertaining to the information which help users possibly find the page
          through an organic search.
          <br />
          <br />
          &bull;&nbsp;All JavaScript HTML and CSS is validated using Validations
          Tools.
          <br />
          These being:

            >CSS: http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/</a

          <br />
          <br />
          Accessibility was validated by using the WAVE® Web Accessibility
          Evaluation Tool browser extension.
          <br />
          <br />
          <a rel="noopener" target="_blank"  href="https://wave.webaim.org/">WAVE: https://wave.webaim.org/</a>
          <br />
          <br />
          The domain was also audited using chrome developer tool:
          <br />
          <br />
          <a rel="noopener" target="_blank"  href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse "
            >Google Lighthouse:
            https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse
          </a>
          <br />
          <br />
          To make sure that coding was up to standard in the
          areas of <span>performance</span>, <span>best practise</span>, <span>accessibility</span> and <em><span>SEO</span></em>. Where the
          server or the domain code was not meeting the requirements,
          adjustments were made. For Example the SEO section checks for the
          state of the servers robots.txt file. So the file was created along
          with its accompanying sitemap.xml file.
          <br />
          <br />
          &bull;&nbsp;The site was registered with the search engines Bing and
          Google by using their page tag verification keys uploaded to the site.
          While google analytics tags were also included. Then the domain URLS
          were indexed. The domain “perthfootballfixtures.online” was chosen as
          it is easy to remember, type and is relevant to the football world.
          Furthermore conventional SEO friendly URLS are implemented using
          subdirectories and with multiple words separated by dashes to create a
          common sense user experience when trying to use the URLS, and allow
          for registration when the search engine platform is processing this
          convention for indexing. As part of the indexing process on these
          platforms, the site is checked to see if it meets findability
          requirements prior to being added. Any issues preventing Indexing are
          listed in a report and were then adjusted to pass the checks.
          Specifically this meant that the length of the text in page title
          elements needed to be adjusted.
          <br />
          <br />
          &bull;&nbsp;If a user somehow finds themselves searching for something
          that cannot be found. They will be presented with a 404 not found page
          when the server is responding with that error. This page will aid
          users in allowing them to navigate back to findable content, and
          inform them of what problem they are actually facing by not being able
          to find something. Achieving the goal of trying to keep users using
          the domain, and not going elsewhere.
          <br />
          <br />
          &bull;&nbsp;The marketing strategy used to create inbound links and
          referring sites, is that social media platforms and their sharing
          features, are found on the home page. The strategy being that a
          football fan can share the site's domain on social media among their
          personal networks, so that awareness of the site is advertised and
          linked to social media posts.
          <br />
          <br />
          &bull;&nbsp;Analysing Traffic data metrics for areas of improvement
          and errors is facilitated through Google's analytics platform and also
          through a server log analyzer called GoAccess, combined with the cloud
          SEO platforms for Bing webmasters and Google search Console. Any not
          found URLS are investigated along with other bad HTTP status codes
          that browsers may be producing.
          <br />
          <br />
          Other key metrics monitored to successfully optimize this site are:
          <br />
          <br />
          Audience:
          <br />
          The number of views received from specific demographics.
          <br />
          <br />
          Acquisition:
          <br />
          Where visitors are coming from, possibly from a direct search, though
          an advertisement, or external referral links.
          <br />
          <br />
          Sessions:
          <br />
          How long a visitor is spending on the domain.
          <br />
          <br />
          Pageviews:
          <br />
          The specific amount of views single pages on a domain receive.
          <br />
          <br />
          Bounce Rate:
          <br />
          When visitors enter and exit the domain from the same page.
          <br />
          <br />
          Goals have been set on this metric data and efforts have been made to
          change the site where the data indicated that users were not
          fulfilling these goals.
